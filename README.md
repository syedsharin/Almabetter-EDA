Hotel Booking project.
Have you ever wondered when the best time of year to book a hotel room is? Or the optimal length of stay in order to get the best daily rate? What if you wanted to predict whether or not a hotel was likely to receive a disproportionately high number of special requests? This hotel booking dataset can help you explore those questions!
This data set contains booking information for a city hotel and a resort hotel, and includes information such as when the booking was made, length of stay, the number of adults, children, and/or babies, and the number of available parking spaces, among other things. All personally identifying information has been removed from the data.
Explore and analyze the data to discover important factors that govern the bookings.

Conclusion
From this EDA, we have observed that the top 5 most important features in the data set which will help the hotel in predicting the booking demand and in Revenue management are that most hotels are booked is the city hotel ,that is around 61.45% ,so You really need to spend more money on those hotels.
And most of the bookings are done through online TA (travel agencies),this can be taken as business opportunity by marketing and advertising on their website since majority of customers tend to reach out to them for booking ,this can be because of the ease of booking from the website and to skip middleman.
Most number of hotel booking request came in the month of July and August followed by May and October. One reason for this may be the weather impact as these are the months of pleasant weather in Portugal.
August is the busiest month and January month is the least occupied month. The marketing teams attention can be drawn to this , in order to come up with ideas to capitalize on this.
Mostly the visitors are from Western Europe. This gives another reason to spend a part of  budget in that area to increase revenue.
Analysis showed that the number of adults and children is higher in the case of the city hotel. This means that the city hotel is the better choice for large families.
Data insights showed that hotels do not have repeated visitors. This can be taken as an opportunity to work and target on this area to attract repeated customers. since the customers have already booked before , they can be offered discount on subsequent bookings, given privilege services and their feedbacks should be taken seriously for further improvement.
